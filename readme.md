an example of a difficult issue or bug and how you resolved it. I had to learn a lot about test harness  how it works and what module to import  for it.  After figuring it out and executing the code the program produced output in a different manner than expected and also causing mismatch errors in the test harness. I had corrected it later on and had to be careful with details like spacing , line breaks and character cases.
5.Extension 1: More Advanced wc - Multiple Files
Description: Extend the wc utility to support multiple files. When multiple files are provided as arguments, the program should print individual statistics for each file and a total line for all files.
Extension 2: More Advanced wc - Flags to Control Output
Description: Implement flags for the wc utility to control the information shown. For example, support flags like -l for counting lines only, -w for counting words only, and -c for counting characters only. Additionally, allow combining flags (e.g., -lc for counting lines and characters).
Extension 3: More Advanced gron - Control the Base-Object Name
Description: Enhance the gron utility to allow specifying a different base object name using a --obj flag. By default, gron uses "json" as the base object name. With the flag, users can provide a custom base object name.
